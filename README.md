# RRule

RRule is a wrapper around the Rust based library [rrule](https://github.com/fmeringdal/rust-rrule).

To consume it in your projects, you'll need to have a Rust compiler [installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `rrule` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:rrule, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
